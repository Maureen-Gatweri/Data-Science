 ## Tuples
                   Definition of Tuples
A tuple is an ordered data structure that is used to store different items in a single variable. Tuples are immutable.
Tuples can contain elements of different data types, for example, strings, integers, 
Tuples are immutable and that gives them the ability to be used as dictionary keys because they are immutable. 
Tuples are accessed using their indices.

## Stacks
                   Definition of Stacks
A stack is a data structure there the addition of a new element and removal of an existing element that takes place at the same end known as "top of the stack.
Elements are added one by one.
Stacks use the LIFO-FILO concept, meaning the first element to be added is the last one to be added, and the last one to be added is the last one to be removed.
-Stacks are ordered
- Accessing an item in the middle would require you to remove all the items above it till you get to the item you want.
- Stacks can contain duplicate values
  ## QUEUES
